# Demand Forecasting & Spend Impact (MLOps)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps system that forecasts weekly demand by channel and quantifies the downstream impact on marketing spend and ROI.

The system is designed using Kubeflow pipelines, Docker, Terraform, and a GCP-ready architecture, while being executed locally for cost efficiency.
